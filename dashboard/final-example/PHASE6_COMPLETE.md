2. **Documentation First**: Writing comprehensive guides helped clarify architecture decisions

3. **Incremental Approach**: Breaking into 6 phases made the project manageable and trackable

4. **AI Collaboration**: AI excelled at infrastructure code and documentation, human crucial for architecture decisions and business logic

5. **Testing Strategy**: 3-tier approach (E2E + integration + load) provides comprehensive coverage

### Process Lessons

1. **Plan Before Code**: Designing all 6 phases upfront saved time and prevented rework

2. **Document As You Go**: Creating PHASE*_COMPLETE.md files after each phase kept progress clear

3. **Automate Everything**: Deployment scripts save time and reduce errors

4. **Security From Start**: Building security layers from the beginning is easier than retrofitting

5. **Cost Awareness**: Understanding AWS pricing informed architecture decisions

### AI Usage Lessons

1. **AI for Boilerplate**: AI excellent for configuration files, infrastructure code, documentation templates

2. **Human for Strategy**: Architecture decisions, technology selection, testing approach require human judgment

3. **Always Validate**: All AI-generated code reviewed, tested, and modified to fit requirements
