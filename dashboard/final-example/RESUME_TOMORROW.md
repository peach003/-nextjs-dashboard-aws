# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide for Tomorrow

## To Resume Our Work:

### 1. Share This With Me Tomorrow
When you start a new chat session, copy and paste this:

```
I'm continuing the Next.js Dashboard AWS deployment project.
We completed Phase 1 (local setup).

Here's our progress document:
[Then paste the contents of PROJECT_PROGRESS.md or just say "read PROJECT_PROGRESS.md"]

Let's continue with Phase 2: SST Infrastructure Setup.
```

### 2. What You Can Do Today (Optional)

**Test the Application**:
```bash
cd /home/zhanglin/devops/next-learn/dashboard/final-example
npm run dev
```
Then open: http://localhost:3001

**Login Credentials**:
- Email: `user@nextmail.com`
- Password: `123456`

**Explore Features**:
- View dashboard with revenue chart
- Browse invoices (search, pagination)
- Create/Edit/Delete invoices
- View customer list

### 3. Prepare for Tomorrow (Optional)

**Check AWS Access**:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
If this doesn't work, you'll need to configure AWS CLI:
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Secret Access Key
# Default region: us-east-1 (or ap-southeast-2)
# Default output: json
```

**Check GitHub**:
- Decide if you want to fork the repo or create a new one
- We'll need it for CI/CD pipeline

### 4. Tomorrow's Session Plan

**Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (~2-3 hours)**
1. Initialize SST in project
2. Create infrastructure stacks (Database, Security, Monitoring)
3. Configure OpenNext
4. Set up AWS resources

**What We'll Create**:
- Lambda functions for serverless Next.js
- CloudFront CDN distribution
- RDS Aurora PostgreSQL
- WAF security rules
- CloudWatch monitoring

### 5. Important Files

**Keep These Safe**:
- `/home/zhanglin/devops/next-learn/dashboard/final-example/.env.local` (has DB credentials)
- `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` (our progress tracker)

**DO NOT Commit to Git**:
- `.env.local`
- `node_modules/`
- `.next/`
